# InferredTypes

### ðŸ”¥ Surprisingly small type definition

Traditional Redux could not be said to be compatible with static type for ActionType.
One purpose of this helper is to guide InferredTypes in every corner with minimal definition.

By the map of Type inference in conditional types, 
mutation's second argument will map to action creator's payload.
(required ^TypeScript 2.8)

If you use this library, development with TypeScript is strongly recommended.
